  ## This function performs a sensitivity analysis for Fisher's Exact Test
  ## for count (binary) data. It is derived from Section 4.4 of Paul
  ## Rosenbaumâ€™s ``Observational Studies" (2nd Ed., 2002). The test is
  ## one-sided; that is, the alternative hypothesis to the null is
  ## that the number of "successes" (however defined) greater in among
  ## the "treated" (however defined).
  ##
  ## It takes five arguments:
  ##   'totalN': total number of observations
  ##   'treatedN': number of observations that received treatment
  ##   'totalSuccesses': total number of "successes"--i.e., 1's
  ##   'treatedSuccesses': number of successes among the treated
  ##   'Gammas': a vector Gammas (bounds on the differential odds of 
  ##  treatment) at which to test the significance of the results.
  ##
  ## It returns a matrix of Gammas and upper and lower bounds on the exact 
  ## p-value for Fisher's test.
