Description: Takes matched and unmatched data and calculates Rosenbaum bounds for the treatment effect.  Calculates bounds for binary outcome data, Hodges-Lehmann point estimates, Wilcoxon signed-rank test for matched data and matched IV estimators, Wilcoxon sum rank test, and for data with multiple matched controls. The sensitivity analysis methods in this package are documented in Rosenbaum (2002) Observational Studies, <doi:10.1007/978-1-4757-3692-2>, Springer-Verlag.
